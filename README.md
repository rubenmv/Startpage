# Simple Weather Page

**Simple Weather Page** is a simple start/new tab page for browsers. It shows time, date and weather, and includes a box for Google Encrypted search.

This page was made using AngularJS.

I include the sources (src) and the compiled files (dist).
No need to install anything, it runs directly from the index.html file.
